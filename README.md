# ProjetoFront
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.
It is a web app to control and display stored devices and equipments alongside its points, and data.

## Run the App
To run the aplication on a new browser window paste the cmd: `ng serve --open`, and the application will automatically load on a new browser window.
It will be using port 4200!

As a styling option I decided to go for the Angular Material viewing some productivity and high compatibility with angular.

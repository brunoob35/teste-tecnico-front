# ProjetoFront
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.
It is a web app to control and display automated light switches as a technical test

## Run the App
To run the aplication on a new browser window paste the cmd: `ng serve --open`, and the application will automatically load on a new browser window!

As a styling option I decided to go for the Angular Material viewing some productivity and high compatibility with angular.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
